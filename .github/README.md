## Documentation

### Setup

This Project is set up to work on both Linux and Windows with a few tweaks
I am using CLion to develop it, and I am trying to make it work out-of-the-box on both platforms

#### Linux (Debian Based)

Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libopenal-dev
```

#### Windows

Every Include & Binary is in `/external`, should work as-is

#### macOS & iOS

I am not planning on making macOS & iOS Support, but I would appreciate if you did!

#### Android

I am planning on porting the engine to Android in the future, but it won't come anytime soon!

#### WASM (Emscripten)

WASM support is coming soon!
