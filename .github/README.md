# Artifex - 2D Game Engine

## About
C++ Game Engine for making 2D Games

Uses...
- [GLFW](www.glfw.org) + [OpenGL](www.opengl.org) for Windowing + Rendering

## Documentation

### Setup

This Project is set up to work on both Linux and Windows with a few tweaks
I am using CLion to develop it, and I am trying to make it work out-of-the-box on both platforms

#### Linux (Debian Based)

> Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```

#### Windows

> Update GLFW
If you wish to update the GLFW library, grab the [latest version](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) and replace the files from [include/GLFW](../include/GLFW) and [lib/GLFW](../lib/GLFW)
It should work out of the box if you are using a CMake based build system (tested with CLion)

More details coming soon!

#### MacOS

I am not planning on making macOS Support, but I would appreciate if you did!

### Usage

Coming Soon!
